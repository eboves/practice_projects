## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

# this convert the index to the date value
df.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index)
# Sorting by the date index, most recent first

# this extract the closing prices for yesterday and the day before yesterday
yesterday_close = df.loc[df.index[0], "4. close"]

# this Compare the closing prices
print(f"Yesterday's closing price ({df.index[0].date()}): {yesterday_close}")

diff = abs(ayer - antes_ayer)

diff_per = (diff / ayer) * 100 

print(diff_per)

if diff_per > 5.00:
    print("Get NEWS")


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

df_news = pd.DataFrame(news_data)
slice_data = df_news[:3]
title = slice_data["articles"][0]["title"]
print(title)
print(slice_data)

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
